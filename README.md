# Data Science Projects by Romain Priour

This portfolio is a compilation of projects which I created for data analysis or for the use of machine learning algorithms. 

## Data Cleaning and Visualization Projects

### 911 Data Visualization

### Financial Analysis Projects

## Web Scraping Projects

### Basic NBA Webscrape

This project was my first introduction to web scraping, taking data from basketball-reference.com and turning it into a usable CSV file. 

## Machine Learning Projects

### Fake Advertising data: Logistic Regression
This project used a logistic regression algorithm on a fake advertising data set to determine whether a user clicked on a particular ad or not. 

### Classifying Universities as Private or Public: K Means Clustering 
Implementing a K Means Clustering algorithm to classify a university as Private or Public. 

### Linear Regression
Used a data set from a hypothetical company to determine whether they would need to upgrade their website or their phone application. This project helped combine business decisions with machine learning implementation.
